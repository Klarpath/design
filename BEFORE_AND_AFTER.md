### About Section

**BEFORE:**

Our Story: From European Roots to London Code

We are Klarpath, a family of developers united by a shared passion for clean code 
and exceptional design. Our story begins on the old continent, but our ambition led us 
to London, a city that beats with a digital pulse like no other...

But our education wasn't just academic. We immersed ourselves in the vibrant London 
lifestyle, embracing the rich tapestry of British culture. We moved not just for opportunity, 
but to become part of the fabric of this cherished Island...
```

**AFTER:**
```
Why We Started Klarpath

After working with dozens of small business owners across London, we noticed the same 
problem over and over: most web builders trap you in their ecosystem. You pay monthly 
subscriptions, you can't own your code, and if you want to switch providers, you're stuck.

We founded Klarpath to change that. Our team has Master's degrees in IT from Northumbria 
University London, Solent Southampton, and Roehampton University. More importantly, we 
understand what actually works for tradies, professionals, and small business owners looking 
to attract more customers online.

Our approach is different: you get a beautiful, fast website that you actually own. 
No vendor lock-in. No paying forever. Just a professional online home for your business...
```

**Why Better:**
- ✅ Problem-first (not story-first)
- ✅ Clear value proposition
- ✅ Authentic, conversational tone
- ✅ Removes flowery "European roots" language
- ✅ Focuses on customer benefits, not team background
